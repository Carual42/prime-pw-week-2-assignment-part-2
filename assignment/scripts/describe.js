// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// setting variable "name" as the string 'Dane'
// setting up a conditional to test variable name and if it equals 'Mary"
// The name variable doesnt match 
//it console logs 'How do you do?'

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// setting variable secret and variable code. code is set to 123
// setting up a conditional to see if the variable code is equal to 123 
// its does equate to true so the loop sets secret variable to the string 'super' and multiplies codes value by 2
// and sets its value to 246
// setting up a conditional to see if code's vaule is greater than 250 (it isnt)
//console logs super

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// assigns var isStudent to true, age to 34, and zup to 55407
// sets up conditional to test if var isStudent is true AND zip is greater than 80000
// sets up conditional to test if var isStudent is false OR age is less than 30
// sets up conditional to test if var isStudent is true AND
// if all previous conditions equate to false this will console log 'how about the weather
// console logs Welcome to Prime!

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
//FIX - colorOne should be set to 'blue' and colorTwo should be set to 'red'
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
//FIX - add colorTwo = 'purple
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

// FIX - || change to &&
if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;

// FIX - change <= to >=
if(minAge <= age) {
  console.log('no entry');
} else {
  console.log('enter');
